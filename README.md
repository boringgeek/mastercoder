This is a workshop to get developers started on AWS using the cloud native primitives. This workshop is designed as a self paced lab which incrementally increases in expertise

We will build a simple web app based on microservices using the 12 factor methodology, deploy it on the cloud and try some debug steps.

We will do this workshop in a pair programming mode. So find a buddy.
